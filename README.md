# Can we predict the rating of a horror movie?

Halloween means horror movies. On [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-horror-movie-dataset), there is a dataset of 3300 horror movies from 2012 to 2017. The dataset contains the following fields:

* `Title`
* `Genres`
* `Release Date`
* `Release Country`
* `Movie Rating`
* `Review Rating`
* `Movie Run Time`
* `Plot`
* `Cast`
* `Language`
* `Filming Locations`
* `Budget`

Given these fields, would it be possible to predict the rating of a movie based upon its other features?
